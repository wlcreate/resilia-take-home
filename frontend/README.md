# Resilia Take Home - Frontend

The following is repeated from the main repo README, however in case it is easier to read the frontend's information separately from the backend I have decided to include this README.

## Tech Stack

- React
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node Package Manager (`npm`)
- Node.js

Follow the [instructions here to install Node.js and `npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/). Note that `npm` is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer.

### Installing

**Note**: For convenience, it's important to start the backend (Rails) server first. By doing so, Rails will be available at `localhost:3000` and then the frontend (React) will change to a different port after prompting you in the terminal (simply type `y` once the prompt appears). You will then be able to view the frontend at `localhost:3001`.

Assuming you have already cloned the main repo and have a tab in your terminal specifically for this directory (`cd frontend`):

- install all required dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Executing

- Run the server:

```
npm start
```

- Open http://localhost:3001 with your browser to see the result.
